# hello-world
My very first repository - GitHub introdutory tutorial

Never used a place to keep my work.
So now that I've decided to learn how to code, I felt the necessities to come up with GitHub

So in this tutorial I accomplished:
* Create an open souce repository;
* Start and manage a new branch;
* Change a file and commit those changes to GitHub;
* Open and merge a Pull Request.

Nice and clean.
